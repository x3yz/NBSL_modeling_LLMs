NBSL for Modeling Interacting LLMs

In the first experiment, after getting the tags associated with each of the three selected movies, we first reindex the tags, leading to the dataset in the file "Expriment1/tag\_lookup\_array.pkl". We then manually create a split of all the tags into six related categories and randomly further split each of the six groups in half with the numpy random seed 42. We then get tags associated with every movie.  The result is an array $moviegroups$, with $K_1=12$ groups that can be found in the file "Experiment1/Moviegroups1.pkl" file in the repository. If the correct movie is $\theta$, $moviegroups_{\theta, k}$ fixes the tags that the agent $k$ will be able to receive during the experiment. We then, using the random seed 42 and numpy.random library, get a random permutation of the first $20$ numbers, $perm$. Then at time $i$ agent $k$ in both the NBSL algorithm~\ref{alg:NBSL_extraction} and LLM algorithm~\ref{alg:llm_extraction} receives the tag with index $moviegroups_{\theta^*,k,perm_i}$.\\
